Colour detection for images

1.	Remember that the main colour detection has already been copied to the Object-Detection-API folder.
2.	This is where you can test the color detection on jpg images.
3.	For testing run the test.py code
4.	The latest color detection “color_detection_final.py”, is run in which 6 pixels are taken as input and the color is detected and the most frequent color is displayed. 
5.	Remember while using in Object-Detection-API, each frame of the image is given as input and the pixel’s x and y coordinates are calculated from the bounding box centre coordinates.
6.	If only the centre pixel is to be found, run the color_detection_mark3.py
7.	Remember to download all the dependencies for python.

Remember to run these two files, you have to run the “test.py” and uncomment the import python file you want and comment the import python file you do not want. (color_detection_final.py or color_detection_mark3.py)
